# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental pillars of OOP.

## <ins>In short:</ins>
> *"Encapsulation is the idea of enclosing data and operations used for a certain set/type of data into a single entity. This also serves as a way to control access that users and devs have to the data and operations for a given entity. This entity is known as **'an Object'***

So, this *"single entity"* is made up of:
1. data 
2. operations 

At the core, you could say that objects are just containers for a certain sets of data and operations.

As mentioned in the *"In short"* section, encapsulation can act as a way to control the access a user could have to the data. An entity can *encapsulate* data and keep it private from *outsiders*.

There are supposedly ways to make that data accessbile from outside of the entity through interfaces that a dev creates (?) that a user can interact with.

> ðŸ§  I'm imagining this could act as a way to control what data in an entity can and can't be manipulated from within or project/codebase. My guess is that this serves as a way to create more predicatable and stable behaviour in an application.
